Assignment #1: Clone the google homepage

4/4/21 - So far, I've mostly learned how to use the dev tools in the browser to find, copy, and modify CSS. The HTML portion was pretty straight-forward although I have had to modify it here and there to fit with the changes to the CSS. This has been far more complex and challenging than I expected.

4/5/21 - Continuing with the styling of the homepage. Working on the footer at this point.
